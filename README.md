Yoga Steps Detection and Prediction System
This project involves a computer vision-based application that identifies yoga poses in real-time using a webcam. Built with Python, Machine Learning, and SQLite DB3, the system is designed to help yoga practitioners monitor their poses and improve their practice while allowing instructors to provide personalized feedback.

Abstract
Yoga is a widely practiced discipline combining body postures and breathing exercises for physical and mental well-being. This system detects and predicts eight yoga poses—Bhadrasan, Shavasan, Gomukhasan, Vajrasan, Sarvangasan, Shirsansan, Chakrasan, and Dhanurasan—in real-time.

Key Features:
Dataset Preparation: Collected and annotated 501 virtual body and face coordinates for each pose. Data was normalized and split into training and testing sets.
Model Development: Used OpenCV and MediaPipe to extract features and train the model, achieving an average accuracy of 95%.
Real-Time Detection: Captures live webcam video, extracts coordinates, and predicts yoga poses with real-time feedback on the screen.
User Management: Integrated a user registration and login system using tkinter and SQLite for secure access.
Applications:
- Practitioners can monitor and enhance their poses.
- Instructors can provide personalized guidance and feedback.
- Future enhancements include expanding the dataset to include additional yoga poses and integrating advanced feedback mechanisms to further improve accuracy.
